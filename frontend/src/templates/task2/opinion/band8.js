    fullExample: `The impact of technology on social relationships has prompted intense discussion, with commentators divided over whether it brings people together or drives them apart. This essay will evaluate both the concerns and the benefits before giving a considered view.

Opponents of pervasive digital use maintain that substituting online interaction for face-to-face contact diminishes the depth and emotional quality of relationships. Online communication tends to be more fragmentary and asynchronous, and research increasingly links excessive screen time with anxiety and poorer attention spans among young people. These phenomena suggest that unregulated use can produce unintended psychological consequences and weaken the social skills required for sustained interpersonal bonds.

Conversely, advocates emphasize that digital tools create opportunities for connection that were previously impossible. Video conferencing, instant messaging and social platforms allow families separated by distance to sustain daily contact, and professionals to collaborate across time zones. For many migrant workers and expatriates, these technologies serve as a vital lifeline, preserving relationships that physical separation would otherwise erode.

While the risks of overdependence are real, I contend that the integrative potential of technology outweighs its drawbacks, provided users adopt balanced habits and institutions promote digital literacy and mental health awareness. In short, technology can enrich human connection rather than replace it if applied thoughtfully.`

      "Introduction: Debates about energy policy have intensified in recent years; this essay will consider arguments for renewable energy and its perceived limitations before drawing a conclusion.",
      "Body 1: Advocates of renewables argue that they are indispensable for long-term environmental sustainability and energy security, citing examples where investment in wind and solar has cut emissions and stimulated green industries.",
      "Body 2: Critics, however, point to intermittency, infrastructure costs and transition challenges, claiming that without adequate storage and grid upgrades renewables cannot yet meet baseload demand reliably.",
      "Conclusion: Despite practical obstacles, I believe the long-term environmental and economic benefits of renewable energy justify continued investment and policy support, alongside measures to address integration challenges."
    ],
    fullExample: `Debates about energy policy have intensified in recent years as governments weigh the trade-offs between economic growth and environmental responsibility. This essay will consider arguments for renewable energy and its perceived limitations before drawing a conclusion.

Proponents maintain that renewables are essential for achieving sustainable development and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Investments in wind and solar capacity have demonstrably lowered national emissions in several countries and spawned new industries and jobs. For instance, nations that prioritized renewables have seen both cleaner air and burgeoning clean-tech sectors, indicating a dual environmental and economic payoff.

Detractors, however, stress the technical and fiscal hurdles associated with a rapid transition. Intermittency remains a central concern: without large-scale storage solutions and substantial grid modernization, renewable sources can struggle to provide consistent baseload power. Moreover, the upfront capital required for infrastructure and transition can strain public finances, particularly in developing economies.

On balance, while acknowledging these challenges, I believe the long-term advantages of renewable energy—reduced environmental harm, innovation-driven growth and enhanced energy independence—outweigh the drawbacks. The prudent approach is to intensify investment in renewables while simultaneously financing grid upgrades and storage technologies to ensure a reliable and equitable transition.`

      "Introduction: Urban transport planning provokes divergent views on whether cities should prioritise public transit or private vehicles; this essay will explore both positions and state a reasoned opinion.",
      "Body 1: Supporters of public transport argue it mitigates congestion, lowers per-capita emissions and promotes social equity, with examples of cities where comprehensive transit networks have improved urban mobility and quality of life.",
      "Body 2: Advocates of private car use counter that personal vehicles offer unmatched flexibility, convenience and accessibility in poorly served areas, a point accentuated where public alternatives are underfunded or inefficient.",
      "Conclusion: Although private cars have practical merits, I favour investment in public transport due to its broader environmental and social benefits, provided that planners ensure affordability and coverage to reduce exclusion."
    ],
    fullExample: `Urban transport planning provokes divergent views on whether cities should prioritise public transit or private vehicles, and this debate has significant implications for sustainability and social inclusion. This essay will explore both positions and state a reasoned opinion.

Proponents of public transport emphasise its capacity to alleviate traffic congestion, reduce emissions and provide affordable mobility for all citizens. Well-designed transit systems—characterised by high frequency, reliability and integration—have transformed mobility in cities such as Seoul and Zurich, reducing car dependency and improving urban air quality. Moreover, investment in public transit advances social equity by providing access to employment and services for lower-income residents.

By contrast, supporters of private car use stress the flexibility and door-to-door convenience that cars afford, particularly in suburban or peri-urban areas where transit coverage is sparse. In regions with inadequate infrastructure, private vehicles can be indispensable for commuting and accessing services, and transition policies must account for these practical realities.

On balance, while recognising the conveniences of private cars, I favour prioritising public transport because of its long-term environmental advantages and potential to create more inclusive cities. Crucially, this must be accompanied by policies that improve service coverage and affordability so the benefits are equitably distributed.`
