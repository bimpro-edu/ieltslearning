    fullExample: `Some people argue that the Internet is a negative development, while others believe it brings more benefits. This essay will discuss both views and share my opinion.

One reason people think the Internet is negative is because it can create health and social problems. For instance, young people often spend many hours playing games or watching videos online. This reduces the time they spend exercising or meeting friends face-to-face, which can cause stress or health issues such as eye problems.

However, other people believe the Internet is a positive development. They argue that it has made communication much easier. Families can use video calls to stay connected even if they live in different countries. Moreover, students can find useful study materials, which improves their education.

In conclusion, I believe the Internet is mainly positive. While it can cause problems if people use it too much, it is very helpful for learning and staying in touch with others.`

    fullExample: `Nowadays, people have different opinions about whether the Internet is a positive or negative development. This essay will look at both sides and give my own opinion.

    fullExample: `People do not agree about whether the Internet is a good or bad development. This essay will examine both views before giving my own opinion.

Some people argue that the Internet is a negative development. They say that people spend too much time indoors using computers and phones, which reduces outdoor activity and exercise. They also believe that face-to-face communication has decreased, which may cause social problems.

In contrast, other people believe the Internet is very positive. It allows people to communicate quickly, no matter where they are. In addition, it helps people study or work more effectively because information is easy to find online.

In conclusion, I believe the Internet is more positive than negative. Still, people should be careful and use it wisely to avoid health and social problems.`
