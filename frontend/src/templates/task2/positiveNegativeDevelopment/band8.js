    fullExample: 'The issue of whether the rise of remote work constitutes a positive or negative development remains contentious. Advocates assert it results in greater flexibility and reduced commuting, as demonstrated by increased job satisfaction in remote teams. In contrast, critics maintain it leads to isolation and weaker team cohesion, illustrated by studies on remote work challenges. Although both arguments are valid, I believe remote work is a positive development due to its flexibility and potential for work-life balance.'
