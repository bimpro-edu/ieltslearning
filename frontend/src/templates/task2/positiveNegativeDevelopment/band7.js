    fullExample: `The rapid rise of the Internet has sparked debate about whether it represents a positive or negative development. This essay will examine both perspectives before presenting my view.

On the one hand, critics claim that the Internet brings several disadvantages. They argue that excessive screen time often results in physical health problems such as eye strain and obesity due to a sedentary lifestyle. Moreover, some believe that reliance on online platforms has reduced the quality of face-to-face interactions, leaving many individuals socially isolated.

On the other hand, supporters stress the advantages the Internet provides. It has revolutionized communication, allowing families and colleagues to remain connected across long distances. Furthermore, it offers unparalleled educational opportunities, as students can instantly access vast amounts of information and academic materials.

In conclusion, while the Internet does create challenges related to health and social life, I believe it is a largely positive development. If people use it wisely and in moderation, it can be an essential tool for learning and global connection.`

    fullExample: `Many people debate whether the Internet has brought more harm than good. This essay will explore both sides of the argument and explain why I see it as a positive development overall.

Critics argue that the Internet has created serious problems for individuals and society. It can reduce productivity when people spend hours on social media or online games instead of working. It also contributes to unhealthy lifestyles, since individuals may spend long periods sitting indoors. In addition, misinformation and fake news spread quickly online, which can damage trust in public institutions.

Advocates, however, see the Internet as a powerful force for progress. It gives students and professionals instant access to information, improving both education and career opportunities. Online learning platforms, for example, allow people to study at their own pace. Beyond that, the Internet connects people worldwide, enabling cultural exchange and collaboration across borders.

In conclusion, although the Internet does carry risks such as addiction and misinformation, I believe its benefits in terms of knowledge-sharing and global communication far outweigh the negatives.`

      "Body 1: Some believe the Internet is harmful because it weakens real-world interaction and poses health risks. They argue that overuse reduces physical activity and undermines social relationships.",
      "Body 2: Others believe the Internet is highly beneficial. They emphasize its role in supporting education, facilitating professional work, and keeping people connected globally.",

    fullExample: `Opinions differ on whether the Internet is a positive or negative force in modern life. This essay will discuss both viewpoints before giving a reasoned conclusion.

Some people argue that the Internet is a harmful development. They believe it encourages individuals to spend too much time online, which reduces opportunities for outdoor activities and face-to-face interaction. Over time, this can lead to health issues such as obesity, as well as a decline in social and communication skills.

Others, however, highlight the Internet’s many benefits. It enables students and professionals to access educational materials and professional resources more efficiently than ever before. It also helps people remain in contact with friends and family across long distances, which strengthens personal relationships and cultural exchange.

In conclusion, I find the Internet to be more of a positive than a negative development. Although it does have risks, these can be managed by using it in a balanced way, while its benefits for education, work, and communication are undeniable.`
