    fullExample: `Some people think the Internet is a good development, while others think it is a bad development. This essay will explain both sides and give my opinion.

Some people believe the Internet is negative. They think it makes people lazy because they spend too much time online. For example, young people often play games for many hours instead of doing exercise or studying. This can also cause health problems.

On the other hand, other people believe the Internet is positive. They say it helps people talk to each other, even if they live far away. It also helps students study, because they can find information and learn many new things online.

In my opinion, the Internet is more positive than negative. Even though it can cause problems if people use it too much, it is very helpful for communication and education.`
