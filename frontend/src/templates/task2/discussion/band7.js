    fullExample: `The role of technology in modern life is a subject of considerable debate. While some view it as harmful, others argue it offers substantial benefits.

On the one hand, critics emphasize the drawbacks of technology, particularly in terms of health and social behavior. Excessive screen use can lead to problems such as eye strain, poor posture, and reduced physical activity. Moreover, reliance on digital devices may weaken face-to-face interaction, making people more socially isolated.

On the other hand, supporters highlight the many positive aspects of technology. It facilitates instant communication across the globe, enabling people to maintain personal and professional relationships regardless of distance. In addition, it provides unprecedented access to educational resources, allowing students and professionals to acquire knowledge and skills more efficiently than ever before.

In conclusion, technology has both advantages and disadvantages. However, I believe it is largely beneficial, provided individuals use it responsibly and balance it with healthy lifestyle choices.`

    fullExample: `The influence of technology on people’s daily lives has become a controversial issue. Some believe it is harmful, while others claim it is helpful.

Opponents of technology often argue that it contributes to both physical and psychological health problems. For example, spending long hours in front of a screen can lead to eye damage, back pain, and even stress or anxiety. Furthermore, some worry that young people, in particular, are losing the ability to build deep social connections because they prefer online communication to face-to-face interaction.

Advocates, however, emphasize that technology greatly enhances efficiency and opportunities for learning. It enables people to complete tasks more quickly and access an enormous amount of information within seconds. Online platforms also support collaboration among students, researchers, and professionals around the world, which can lead to innovation and shared knowledge.

In my opinion, technology brings more benefits than drawbacks. Nevertheless, it is important to remain aware of its potential harm and take steps to use it in a balanced and healthy way.`

    fullExample: `People hold differing opinions regarding whether technology is more harmful or beneficial. This essay will examine both sides before presenting a personal view.

Those who criticize technology often point to its negative impact on physical and mental well-being. For instance, sitting for long hours in front of computers may cause obesity or poor fitness. Moreover, the constant use of digital devices has been linked to stress, anxiety, and even reduced attention spans.

In contrast, others argue that technology provides significant benefits. It allows people to stay connected through video calls, social media, and instant messaging, which can strengthen family and professional relationships across great distances. Additionally, it plays an essential role in education, as students can attend online classes and access vast amounts of learning materials at any time.

Personally, I am more persuaded by the benefits of technology. While overuse certainly poses risks, when used responsibly, it enriches our lives by offering opportunities for communication, education, and global connection.`
