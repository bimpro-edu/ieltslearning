    fullExample: `Some people think technology is bad for health, while others think it is useful. This essay will look at both sides and give my opinion.

One reason people think technology is bad is because it can make people unhealthy. For example, looking at the computer or phone for many hours can cause eye problems. Also, people spend more time online and less time doing exercise, which makes them less healthy.

On the other hand, many people think technology is very helpful. It lets people talk to each other quickly even if they are in different countries. It also helps students study, because they can search for information and learn new things easily.

In my opinion, technology is more good than bad. Even if it can make some health problems, it is very useful for communication and education.`
