    fullExample: `People hold different views about whether technology is good or bad. This essay will examine both sides and give a personal opinion.

Some people argue that technology is harmful because it makes people less active. For example, children often spend more time playing games or watching videos instead of going outside. This can result in unhealthy lifestyles and over-dependence on electronic devices.

However, others believe technology is very helpful. It allows people to connect with each other quickly through social media and messaging apps. It also makes studying and working more convenient, as information can be found online within seconds.

Personally, I think technology brings more advantages than disadvantages. If people manage their time online responsibly, they can enjoy the benefits of technology without suffering its negative effects.`
