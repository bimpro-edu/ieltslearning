    fullExample: `The pervasive influence of technology has sparked intense debate, with some emphasizing its detrimental consequences and others highlighting its indispensable benefits.

Critics contend that technology undermines both health and social cohesion. Excessive reliance on digital devices often results in sedentary lifestyles, which in turn contribute to obesity and other chronic health issues. Beyond physical health, there is also concern that constant online interaction diminishes empathy and weakens community bonds, leaving individuals more isolated despite being “connected” virtually.

In contrast, proponents argue that technology facilitates unprecedented connectivity and empowers both education and innovation. For instance, communication platforms such as Zoom or WhatsApp enable families separated by migration to maintain strong emotional ties. Furthermore, online learning resources and virtual collaboration tools have democratized access to education and made international cooperation easier than ever before.

Ultimately, while it is true that technology can produce harmful side effects, I believe its transformative benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. If used mindfully and supported by policies that promote digital well-being, technology will continue to enrich human interaction and knowledge sharing on a global scale.`

    fullExample: `Whether technology isolates people or unites them remains a contentious issue, reflecting broader concerns about modern lifestyles.

Opponents emphasize the erosion of traditional interaction and the psychological risks associated with overuse. Adolescents, for example, may spend hours on social media at the expense of outdoor activity, leading to declining physical fitness and heightened anxiety. Moreover, superficial online exchanges are often viewed as inadequate substitutes for genuine human connection.

Advocates, however, highlight technology’s vital role in sustaining global relationships and expanding opportunities. Migrant workers, for instance, rely on video calls to maintain family bonds across continents. In professional contexts, platforms such as Slack and Microsoft Teams have transformed collaboration, enabling multinational teams to operate seamlessly. Beyond communication, technology grants students access to world-class lectures and research regardless of geography.

In my opinion, although risks undeniably exist, technology represents a net positive force. By establishing limits on usage and encouraging responsible digital habits, individuals can maximize its potential while minimizing its harms.`

    fullExample: `Opinions diverge sharply on whether technology does more harm than good to human connection. This essay will critically assess both sides before offering a personal stance.

Those concerned with technology’s harms often highlight its impact on interpersonal skills and growing dependence on digital devices. Young people, for example, may struggle to hold sustained conversations without distraction from smartphones, while some adults admit to feeling anxious when disconnected from the internet. These tendencies, critics argue, could erode the depth and quality of human relationships.

Conversely, supporters view technology as an enabler of cultural exchange, lifelong learning, and global cooperation. Online communities allow individuals with niche interests to connect and collaborate across continents. Likewise, digital platforms support remote education, ensuring that knowledge is no longer confined to elite institutions. In addition, governments and NGOs increasingly rely on digital tools to coordinate international responses to crises such as climate change and pandemics.

Personally, I am convinced that technology’s capacity to unite and empower societies outweighs its potential to isolate. Although its overuse presents undeniable challenges, when applied responsibly, technology strengthens human connection and accelerates progress on a global scale.`
