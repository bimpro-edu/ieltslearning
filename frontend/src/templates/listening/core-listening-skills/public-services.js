    tips: [
      'Listen for types of public services and their purposes. E.g., "The library offers free internet access." ',
      'Pay attention to opening hours, locations, and rules. E.g., "The swimming pool is closed on Mondays." ',
      'Note any problems or complaints mentioned. E.g., "The bus service is often late." ',
      'Underline or write down names of services, places, or officials.'

    traps: [
      'Don\'t confuse different services or facilities. E.g., "post office" vs. "bank".',
      'Be careful with times and locations. E.g., "open until 5pm" vs. "open until 6pm".',
      'Don\'t assume all services are free—listen for costs or requirements.'
    ],
    predictions: [
      'Expect questions about services, rules, and problems. E.g., "What does the community center offer?" ',
      'Some answers may be about solutions to service issues.',
      'You may need to match people to the services they use.'
