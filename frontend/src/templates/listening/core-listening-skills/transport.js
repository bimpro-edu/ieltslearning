    tips: [
      'Listen for types of transport and travel details. E.g., "The train leaves at 7:30am." ',
      'Pay attention to schedules, routes, and costs. E.g., "The bus ticket costs $2." ',
      'Note any problems or delays mentioned. E.g., "The flight was cancelled due to weather." ',
      'Underline or write down times, destinations, or ticket types.'
    ],
    traps: [
      'Don\'t confuse types of transport or routes. E.g., "express train" vs. "local train".',
      'Be careful with times and connections. E.g., "departure" vs. "arrival".',
      'Don\'t assume all tickets are valid for all routes—listen for restrictions.'
    ],
    predictions: [
      'Expect questions about schedules, problems, and costs. E.g., "What time does the bus leave?" ',
      'Some answers may be about solutions to travel issues.',
      'You may need to match people to their travel plans.'
