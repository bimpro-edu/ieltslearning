    tips: [
      'Listen for key missions and dates. E.g., "Apollo 11 landed on the moon in 1969." ',
      'Pay attention to reasons for exploration. E.g., "Scientists want to find life on Mars." ',
      'Note any challenges or risks mentioned. E.g., "Radiation is a major concern for astronauts." ',
      'Underline or write down names of spacecraft or astronauts.'
    ],
    traps: [
      'Don\'t confuse different missions or planets. E.g., "Voyager explored the outer planets, not the moon." ',
      'Be careful with numbers and statistics. E.g., "The mission lasted 8 days, not 18." ',
      'Don\'t assume all missions were successful—listen for failures or problems.'
    ],
    predictions: [
      'Expect questions about achievements, goals, and challenges. E.g., "What was the first spacecraft to leave the solar system?" ',
      'Some answers may be about future plans or technologies. E.g., "Mars colonization is a future goal." ',
      'You may need to match missions to their outcomes.'
