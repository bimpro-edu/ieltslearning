    tips: [
      'Listen for causes and effects of environmental problems. E.g., "Air pollution is caused by car emissions." ',
      'Pay attention to solutions and actions. E.g., "Recycling helps reduce waste." ',
      'Note any statistics or scientific terms mentioned. E.g., "CO2 levels have increased." ',
      'Underline or write down names of organizations or environmental laws.'

    traps: [
      'Don\'t confuse causes with effects. E.g., "Deforestation is a cause, not an effect." ',
      'Be careful with numbers and percentages. E.g., "30% reduction" vs. "70% increase".',
      'Don\'t assume all solutions are equally effective—listen for the speaker\'s evaluation.'
    ],
    predictions: [
      'Expect questions about causes, effects, and solutions. E.g., "What is one way to reduce pollution?" ',
      'Some answers may require inference from examples.',
      'You may need to match problems to their solutions.'
