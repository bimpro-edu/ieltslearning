      "essay": "In the modern era, technology permeates every aspect of our daily existence, sparking debate about whether it simplifies or complicates our lives. While some argue that technological advancement creates unnecessary complexity, I believe that technology fundamentally improves our quality of life through enhanced efficiency and connectivity.\n\nThose who claim technology complicates life point to the overwhelming nature of constant connectivity. For instance, professionals now find themselves answering work emails late into the evening, blurring the boundaries between professional and personal time. Additionally, the rapid pace of technological change requires continuous learning and adaptation, which can be mentally exhausting for many individuals, particularly older generations.\n\nHowever, I would argue that technology's benefits far outweigh these challenges. Firstly, digital tools have dramatically increased productivity across all sectors. Tasks that once required hours of manual labor, such as data analysis or communication with distant colleagues, can now be completed in minutes through sophisticated software and instant messaging platforms. Secondly, technology has democratized access to information and education. Online learning platforms like Coursera and Khan Academy enable millions of people worldwide to acquire new skills regardless of their geographical location or economic status.\n\nFurthermore, technological innovations have revolutionized healthcare, enabling early disease detection through advanced diagnostic equipment and facilitating remote consultations that save lives in rural areas. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated how technology allowed society to continue functioning through remote work and virtual interactions when physical distancing was essential.\n\nIn conclusion, while technology does introduce certain complexities into modern life, its capacity to enhance efficiency, expand access to resources, and improve quality of life makes it an overwhelmingly positive force. The key lies in developing digital literacy and establishing healthy boundaries with technology rather than rejecting its benefits entirely.",

      "question": "Some people think that artificial intelligence will replace human workers in the future. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
      "band": 8,
      "essay": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has prompted considerable debate about its potential to displace human labor entirely. While I acknowledge that AI will inevitably automate certain job functions, I fundamentally disagree that it will completely replace human workers; rather, it will transform the nature of work and create new opportunities that require uniquely human capabilities.\n\nAdmittedly, AI has already demonstrated remarkable proficiency in tasks previously performed by humans. Manufacturing robots now assemble products with greater precision and consistency than human workers, while algorithms can analyze vast datasets and identify patterns beyond human cognitive capacity. In sectors such as customer service, chatbots handle routine inquiries efficiently, reducing the need for large call center workforces. These examples illustrate AI's growing role in automating repetitive, data-intensive, or dangerous tasks.\n\nHowever, several factors ensure that human workers will remain indispensable. Firstly, many professions require emotional intelligence, creativity, and ethical judgment—qualities that AI currently cannot replicate. Healthcare professionals, for instance, must navigate complex emotional situations with empathy and make nuanced ethical decisions that extend beyond algorithmic processing. Similarly, creative fields such as architecture, education, and counseling demand the human touch, innovative thinking, and interpersonal skills that machines cannot authentically reproduce.\n\nMoreover, history demonstrates that technological revolutions typically create more jobs than they eliminate. The Industrial Revolution, initially feared for threatening manual labor, ultimately generated entirely new industries and employment categories. Similarly, AI will likely spawn novel professions we cannot yet envision, much as the internet created careers in digital marketing, app development, and social media management that were inconceivable decades ago. Workers who adapt by acquiring skills complementary to AI—such as critical thinking, complex problem-solving, and interpersonal communication—will find themselves more valuable than ever.\n\nIn conclusion, while AI will undoubtedly transform the employment landscape by automating routine tasks, it will not render human workers obsolete. Instead, the future will belong to those who can work synergistically with AI, leveraging their distinctly human attributes to solve complex problems and drive innovation. Education systems and workers alike must prepare for this evolution by emphasizing skills that complement rather than compete with artificial intelligence.",

      "question": "Some people believe that social media platforms do more harm than good. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
      "band": 7.5,
      "essay": "Social media has become an integral component of contemporary communication, yet its influence remains contentious. While these platforms undeniably present significant challenges, particularly regarding mental health and privacy, I believe their benefits—especially in fostering connectivity and democratizing information—outweigh the drawbacks when used responsibly.\n\nThe harmful effects of social media are well-documented and merit serious consideration. Research increasingly links excessive social media use to heightened anxiety, depression, and feelings of inadequacy, particularly among adolescents who constantly compare themselves to curated online personas. Furthermore, these platforms have become vehicles for spreading misinformation, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic when false health claims proliferated rapidly. Privacy concerns also loom large, with companies harvesting user data for commercial purposes, often without meaningful consent.\n\nNevertheless, social media platforms offer substantial societal benefits that should not be overlooked. They have revolutionized how people maintain relationships, enabling families separated by vast distances to share experiences instantly through video calls and photo sharing. During natural disasters or political upheavals, platforms like Twitter serve as crucial information channels when traditional media cannot reach affected populations. Additionally, social media has empowered marginalized communities to amplify their voices and mobilize for social change, as evidenced by movements like #MeToo and Black Lives Matter, which gained global momentum through online organizing.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, social media has created entirely new industries and employment opportunities. Content creators, digital marketers, and social media managers represent just a fraction of the careers that now depend on these platforms. Small businesses can now reach global audiences without massive advertising budgets, leveling the commercial playing field in unprecedented ways.\n\nIn conclusion, while social media platforms present genuine risks to mental health, privacy, and information integrity, they remain fundamentally beneficial tools for communication, social mobilization, and economic opportunity. The solution lies not in abandoning these platforms but in implementing stronger regulations, promoting digital literacy, and encouraging mindful usage practices. When approached with awareness and moderation, social media enriches rather than diminishes human connection.",
