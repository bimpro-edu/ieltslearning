      "essay": "Environmental degradation has reached unprecedented levels, prompting debate about whether solutions lie with individual citizens or governmental bodies. While both perspectives hold merit, I believe that effective environmental protection requires coordinated action from individuals, governments, and corporations, as no single entity can address such complex challenges alone.\n\nProponents of individual responsibility argue that collective personal choices create significant environmental impact. When millions of consumers reduce meat consumption, recycle diligently, or choose public transportation over private vehicles, the cumulative effect becomes substantial. Sweden's success in recycling nearly 99% of household waste demonstrates how individual commitment, supported by accessible infrastructure, can transform national environmental outcomes. Furthermore, consumer demand for sustainable products pressures companies to adopt eco-friendly practices, creating market-driven environmental improvement.\n\nConversely, those emphasizing governmental action highlight limitations of individual efforts without systemic change. Environmental problems such as industrial pollution, deforestation, and carbon emissions from large-scale manufacturing require regulatory frameworks that only governments can implement. The European Union's ban on single-use plastics, for example, eliminated billions of plastic items far more effectively than individual boycotts ever could. Additionally, governments possess resources to invest in renewable energy infrastructure, enforce environmental standards, and penalize corporate polluters—capabilities beyond individual reach.\n\nIn my view, environmental solutions emerge from synergy between individual and governmental action. Governments must establish the regulatory framework and infrastructure that enables individuals to make sustainable choices. Simultaneously, engaged citizens must pressure policymakers to prioritize environmental legislation and model the behavioral changes necessary for cultural transformation. Costa Rica's achievement of 99% renewable electricity exemplifies this partnership: governmental investment in renewable infrastructure combined with cultural commitment to environmental stewardship.\n\nIn conclusion, while individuals and governments each have crucial roles in environmental protection, framing the issue as either-or is counterproductive. The most effective environmental progress occurs when governments create enabling conditions for sustainable living, individuals embrace eco-conscious behaviors, and both hold corporations accountable for their environmental impact. Only through this multi-stakeholder approach can we adequately address the scale and complexity of contemporary environmental challenges.",

      "question": "Some people believe that climate change is the most important issue facing humanity today, while others think that economic development should be the priority. Discuss both views and give your opinion.",
      "band": 8,
      "essay": "The apparent tension between addressing climate change and pursuing economic growth represents one of the most contentious debates of our era. While some prioritize environmental sustainability as an existential imperative, others argue that economic development remains essential for human prosperity. I contend that this is a false dichotomy; sustainable economic development that integrates climate considerations offers the only viable path forward.\n\nAdvocates for climate action as the paramount priority present compelling arguments rooted in scientific consensus and observable consequences. Rising global temperatures have already triggered devastating wildfires, intensified hurricanes, and unprecedented droughts that threaten food security worldwide. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that exceeding 1.5°C warming could trigger irreversible ecological collapse, making climate action a survival imperative rather than a policy option. Furthermore, the economic costs of climate inaction—estimated at $23 trillion by 2050—dwarf the investments required for mitigation, suggesting that delaying climate action ultimately undermines economic prosperity.\n\nConversely, those emphasizing economic development highlight legitimate concerns about global inequality and immediate human needs. Billions of people in developing nations lack access to basic necessities such as electricity, clean water, and healthcare—needs that economic growth can address. Restricting industrial development in these regions to meet climate targets risks perpetuating poverty and denying emerging economies the same growth opportunities that enriched developed nations. India and China, for instance, argue that their economic development is essential for lifting hundreds of millions from poverty, and that wealthy nations bear primary responsibility for historical emissions.\n\nHowever, I believe this framing presents a false choice. The transition to renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and circular economies can simultaneously address climate change and drive economic growth. The renewable energy sector already employs over 12 million people globally, demonstrating that green industries create substantial economic opportunities. Countries like Denmark have proven that ambitious climate policies can coexist with robust economic performance—Danish GDP has grown 115% since 1980 while carbon emissions decreased 40%. Moreover, climate change disproportionately harms developing nations through extreme weather and agricultural disruption, making climate action essential for sustainable development.\n\nThe path forward requires reimagining economic development itself. Rather than choosing between climate and economy, we must pursue a green economy that internalizes environmental costs, invests in sustainable infrastructure, and ensures just transitions for affected workers and communities. Developed nations must provide financial and technological support enabling developing countries to bypass fossil fuel-dependent development pathways that the West followed.\n\nIn conclusion, framing climate action and economic development as competing priorities is both inaccurate and dangerous. The climate crisis demands urgent action not despite economic concerns but precisely because long-term prosperity depends on environmental stability. By embracing sustainable development models that integrate climate solutions with economic opportunity, humanity can address both challenges simultaneously—indeed, our survival depends on it.",

      "question": "Some people believe that protecting endangered species is a waste of resources, while others think it is important for the planet's ecosystem. Discuss both views and give your opinion.",
      "band": 7,
      "essay": "The allocation of resources toward endangered species protection remains controversial, with critics viewing it as misplaced priority and advocates emphasizing ecological necessity. While I understand concerns about resource constraints, I believe protecting endangered species is essential for ecosystem health and ultimately benefits human welfare.\n\nSkeptics of species protection programs argue that limited conservation resources could be better directed toward immediate human needs such as poverty alleviation, education, or healthcare. They contend that species extinction is a natural evolutionary process and that some species' disappearance does not significantly impact human life. For example, critics question spending millions to save obscure insects or plants when those funds could build schools or hospitals in underserved communities. This perspective prioritizes direct human benefit over abstract ecological concerns.\n\nHowever, advocates for endangered species protection emphasize the interconnected nature of ecosystems and the often-overlooked benefits species provide. Biodiversity ensures ecosystem resilience; each species plays a role in maintaining ecological balance, and removing one can trigger cascading effects. The loss of bee populations, for instance, would devastate agriculture, as these insects pollinate approximately one-third of the food crops humans consume. Furthermore, many species offer untapped medical and scientific value—approximately 50% of modern medicines derive from natural compounds, and extinct species represent lost opportunities for future discoveries.\n\nAdditionally, endangered species often indicate broader environmental problems affecting humans. Declining amphibian populations signal water pollution and ecosystem degradation that threaten human water supplies. Protecting these species thus serves as an early warning system for environmental hazards.\n\nFrom my perspective, protecting endangered species is not merely about preserving nature for aesthetic or ethical reasons but about safeguarding the ecological systems upon which human civilization depends. The relatively modest investment in conservation programs pales in comparison to the potential costs of ecosystem collapse.\n\nIn conclusion, while resource allocation always involves difficult choices, protecting endangered species represents a prudent investment in planetary health and human future. Rather than viewing conservation as competing with human needs, we should recognize it as essential infrastructure for long-term prosperity. The question is not whether we can afford to protect endangered species, but whether we can afford the consequences of failing to do so.",
