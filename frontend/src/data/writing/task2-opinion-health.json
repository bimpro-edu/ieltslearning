      "question": "Some people think that governments should invest more in promoting healthy lifestyles rather than treating diseases. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
      "band": 7.5,
      "essay": "The allocation of healthcare resources remains a pivotal policy debate, with some advocating for greater investment in preventive health measures over curative treatment. I strongly agree that governments should prioritize promoting healthy lifestyles, as prevention is not only more cost-effective but also addresses the root causes of many contemporary health crises.\n\nFocusing on disease prevention yields substantial economic advantages. Treating chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and obesity places enormous financial strain on healthcare systems worldwide. The United States, for example, spends over $300 billion annually on diabetes-related medical costs—a figure that could be dramatically reduced through preventive interventions such as nutrition education and exercise programs. By investing in public health campaigns that encourage physical activity and balanced diets, governments can reduce long-term healthcare expenditures while simultaneously improving population health outcomes.\n\nMoreover, preventive health initiatives empower individuals to take control of their own wellbeing. Education programs that teach children about nutrition, the dangers of smoking, and the importance of regular exercise cultivate lifelong healthy habits. Japan's mandatory waist measurement program for citizens over 40, for instance, has successfully reduced obesity rates and associated health risks through early intervention and accountability. Such proactive approaches address health issues before they escalate into serious, costly medical conditions.\n\nAdmittedly, adequate treatment facilities remain essential, particularly for acute conditions, genetic disorders, and emergencies that cannot be prevented through lifestyle modifications. However, this does not diminish the importance of prevention. A balanced approach that emphasizes prevention while maintaining quality treatment services represents the optimal strategy.\n\nIn conclusion, governments should indeed prioritize health promotion over disease treatment, as prevention offers superior long-term benefits for both public health and economic sustainability. By shifting resources toward preventive education, infrastructure for active lifestyles, and early intervention programs, societies can create healthier populations while reducing the overwhelming burden on healthcare systems. The most effective health policy is one that stops people from becoming patients in the first place.",

      "question": "Some people believe that unhealthy food should be taxed to encourage healthier eating habits. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
      "band": 7,
      "essay": "The rising prevalence of diet-related health issues has prompted calls for taxation on unhealthy foods as a deterrent to poor nutritional choices. While I recognize the potential benefits of such policies, I partially agree with this approach, as its effectiveness depends heavily on how the revenue is utilized and whether it disproportionately affects low-income populations.\n\nTaxing unhealthy foods can indeed influence consumer behavior. Evidence from countries that have implemented sugar taxes demonstrates measurable reductions in consumption of sweetened beverages. Mexico's 10% tax on sugary drinks, introduced in 2014, resulted in a 12% decrease in purchases within two years. Such fiscal policies make unhealthy options less attractive financially, potentially steering consumers toward healthier alternatives like water, fruits, and vegetables.\n\nFurthermore, revenue generated from these taxes can fund vital public health initiatives. Denmark's former fat tax, despite its eventual repeal, generated significant funds that could theoretically support nutrition education programs, subsidies for healthy foods, or improved healthcare services. This creates a virtuous cycle where harmful consumption finances the very programs designed to reduce it.\n\nHowever, significant concerns exist regarding equity and effectiveness. Regressive taxes disproportionately burden lower-income families, who already struggle with food insecurity and often rely on cheaper, processed foods. Additionally, taxes alone cannot address the complex socioeconomic factors that drive unhealthy eating, such as food deserts, lack of nutrition education, and limited time for meal preparation among working families. Without complementary measures like improved access to affordable healthy food and comprehensive education, taxation may simply punish the poor without solving the underlying problem.\n\nIn conclusion, while taxing unhealthy food represents one tool for promoting better nutrition, it should not be implemented in isolation. A comprehensive approach combining moderate taxation with subsidies for healthy options, nutrition education, and improved food access would more effectively encourage healthier eating habits across all socioeconomic levels. The goal should be making healthy choices both accessible and affordable, not merely making unhealthy choices expensive.",

      "question": "Some people think that mental health should receive the same level of attention and funding as physical health. To what extent do you agree?",
      "band": 8,
      "essay": "For decades, mental health has languished in the shadows of healthcare policy, receiving a fraction of the resources allocated to physical ailments despite affecting millions worldwide. I wholeheartedly agree that mental health deserves equal prioritization, both because psychological wellbeing is inextricably linked to physical health and because the current disparity perpetuates unnecessary suffering and economic loss.\n\nThe artificial distinction between mental and physical health ignores the fundamental interconnection of mind and body. Depression, for instance, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, weakens immune function, and can exacerbate chronic pain conditions. Conversely, physical illnesses often trigger or worsen mental health conditions—cancer patients frequently develop anxiety disorders, while chronic pain sufferers exhibit high rates of depression. This bidirectional relationship demonstrates that optimal health outcomes require integrated treatment of both psychological and physical dimensions. The World Health Organization's definition of health as \"complete physical, mental and social wellbeing\" reflects this holistic understanding, yet healthcare systems have been slow to implement truly integrated care models.\n\nThe economic argument for mental health investment is equally compelling. Depression and anxiety cost the global economy an estimated $1 trillion annually in lost productivity, far exceeding the investment required for comprehensive mental health services. In the workplace, untreated mental health conditions lead to absenteeism, reduced productivity, and higher turnover rates. Early intervention through accessible mental health services prevents conditions from escalating, reduces hospitalization costs, and enables individuals to remain productive members of society. Countries like Australia, which have invested substantially in mental health through programs like Beyond Blue, have seen significant returns in both improved population wellbeing and economic productivity.\n\nFurthermore, the stigma surrounding mental illness—partially stemming from inadequate societal recognition and resources—prevents countless individuals from seeking help. Elevating mental health to parity with physical health in funding and policy sends a powerful message that psychological struggles are legitimate medical concerns deserving compassionate care. This cultural shift could encourage more people to access treatment before crises occur.\n\nSkeptics might argue that physical health emergencies require immediate, resource-intensive interventions that mental health conditions do not. However, this perspective overlooks mental health crises such as acute suicidal ideation, severe psychotic episodes, and debilitating anxiety attacks, which demand urgent specialized care. Moreover, many physical health problems develop gradually and benefit from preventive care—precisely the approach that mental health advocates champion.\n\nIn conclusion, achieving parity between mental and physical health in resources and attention is not merely desirable but essential for comprehensive healthcare. The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that neglecting mental health imposes enormous human and economic costs, while integrated, well-funded mental health services generate substantial returns. Healthcare systems must evolve beyond outdated mind-body dualism to embrace the reality that mental health is health, deserving equal investment, respect, and compassionate care.",
